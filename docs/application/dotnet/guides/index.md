# Tizen .NET Guides

Tizen .NET provides a rich set of interfaces allowing you to build compelling TV, mobile, and wearable (preview) applications which achieve native performance. The programming environment includes the following:

- **.NET Standard API**, which implements the .NET Base Class library, and allows you to use the well-known C# language base class libraries and features, such as collections, threading, file input/output (I/O), and Language Integrated Query (LINQ).
- **Xamarin.Forms**, which allows you to efficiently build a user interface from standard components in C# or XAML.
- **Tizen.Wearable.CircularUI**, which allows you to efficiently add Tizen wearable-specific user interfaces.
- **TizenFX API**, which allows you to access platform-specific features not covered by the generic .NET and Xamarin.Forms features, such as system information and status, battery status, sensor date, and account and connectivity services.
  For the full specification, see the [TizenFX API Reference](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/API5/).

## .NET Standard API

One of the major components of .NET Core is the .NET Standard. The .NET APIs provided by Tizen .NET follow the .NET Standard 2.0. The column titled as 2.0 in the [official list](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) of the supported CoreFX APIs lists all the available .NET APIs.

There are limitations of .NET Standard API on Tizen. For more information, see [Limitations of .NET Standard API on Tizen](dotnet-standard-limitations.md).

## Xamarin.Forms

[Xamarin.Forms](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/getting-started/) provides cross-platform APIs, which allow you to create user interfaces that can be shared across platforms. The Tizen.NET Visual Studio extension enables Tizen support for Xamarin.Forms.

You can efficiently build your Tizen .NET application UI and its supporting logic using the Xamarin.Forms APIs. Extended details for these APIs are available on the [Xamarin Web site](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/namespace/Xamarin.Forms/).

The Tizen.NET contains a few limitations on the Xamarin.Forms APIs; these limitations are to be eliminated in future releases. The following classes are not supported:

- `AppLinkEntry`
- `OpenGLView`

A list of limitations is available at [Current Xamarin.Forms limitations](xamarin-forms-limitations.md).

## Tizen.Wearable.CircularUI

[Tizen.Wearable.CircularUI](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.CircularUI/index.html) provides Tizen wearable-specific user interfaces. It is a set of extension APIs of Xamarin.Forms. Tizen.Wearable.CircularUI APIs are supported only on Tizen wearable devices with Tizen .NET support, unlike the Xamarin.Forms which support cross platforms.

Using these APIs, you can easily and efficiently add Tizen wearable-specific user interfaces to your Tizen wearable application. For more information about these APIs, see [Tizen.Wearable.CircularUI GitHub](https://github.com/Samsung/Tizen.CircularUI).

## TizenFX API

The TizenFX API allows applications to call into platform-specific functionality from the shared code. This functionality enables Xamarin.Forms applications to do things a native application can do, without causing the portable part of the application to become littered with operating system-specific details.

The following table specifies the API Level supported by each version of the Tizen platform:

| Platform Version | API Level | Notes                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tizen 4.0 M2     | 4         | [TizenFX API Reference](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/API4/) |
| Tizen 5.0 M2     | 5         | [TizenFX API Reference](https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/API5/) |


### TizenFX API Guides

TizenFX API introduce various features for Tizen .NET applications. The TizenFX API allows applications to call into platform-specific functionality from the shared code. This functionality enables Xamarin.Forms applications to do things a native application can do, without causing the portable part of the application to become littered with operating system-specific details.

You can use the following TizenFX features in your .NET applications:

- [Applications](applications/overview.md)

  The applications feature covers various application models available for Tizen .NET applications. You can create UI applications to run on the foreground, and specific applications to function as the watch face for the device clock, or as a widget available on the home screen.
